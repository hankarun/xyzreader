This is the sample app of the Udacity "Make It Material" project. Original form of the application uses custom theme and elements of the ui.

All layout implementations are made using Android design library. FrameLayout pbjects changed with new Coordination layouts.

Action bar is changed by AppBar and CollapsingAppbar objects are used to make app more look and feel.
